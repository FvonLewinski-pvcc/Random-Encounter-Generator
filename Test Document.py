In the region of Wolfrun, you encounter: A crumbling sanctuary maintained by a kindly ghost: This old structure once held a shrine visited by travellers on the road. The ghost is the spirit of an old monk who once tended its chapel. The spirit is lonely, and has seen the building fall into disrepair as the woods grew up around its walls.

In the region of Vallaki Valley, you encounter: A trio of giant spiders lurking beneath a footbridge: This old stone bridge crosses a wide ditch fifteen feet across and twelve feet deep, with steep sides and few handholds. Each spider has constructed a web-woven lair beneath a separate side of the bridge. The spiders attack any creature that passes over the footbridge alone. Passers-by can see a well-worn trail that winds toward the south on the Barovian and Vallakian ends of the bridge. Any traveller that follows the trail through the trees eventually comes to a newer wooden bridge that provides safe passage across the ravine
